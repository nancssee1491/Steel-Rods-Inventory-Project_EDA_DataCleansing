Since business objectives are to minimize underutilization of offcuts steel rods & 
to maximize profitability, which means to solve the cutting stock problem, therefore
features selected here are to provide information about characteristics which affecting 
the cutting pattern, as well as information about customer orders. Hence, features 
selected are:
1) Dia (different thickness may need different cutting way)	
2) Dia group (different thickness may need different cutting way)
3) Grade (higher quality level of steel rods probably harder to cut)	
4) Quantity (order quantity represents quantity to cut)
5) Rate (selected as cost may affect order quantity)

'''1) Business decision moments of 'Dia':'''

steel.Dia.mode()

# Count & frequency (in %) for 'Dia':
Dia_count = steel.Dia.value_counts()
Dia_frequency = steel.Dia.value_counts(normalize=True) * 100


'''2) Business decision moments of 'Dia group':'''
# 1st:
steel['Dia group'].mode()

Inferences for 'Dia', 'Dia group', 'Grade' features:
1) The most popular types of TMT rods which have received the maximum numbers of 
   orders are: 8mm in thickness, with assorted set of thickness in 12mm - 32mm, 
   and 500D in grade.
2) Except for thickness ('Dia' feature), the difference in popularity among the 
   most preferred and less preferred options in terms of quality level ('Grade')
   and assorted set of different thickness ('Dia group') are more than & about 
   50% respectively.

Inferences for 'Quantity' & 'Rate' features:
1) Both features are having outliers, but there are more outliers in 'Quantity'.
2) Both are right skewed, which means high frequencies at lower order quantity 
   side with cheaper charging cost for TMT rods are more common. 
3) As a larger standard deviation indicates greater variability or dispersion of 
   data points from the mean, therefore the costs of TMT rods per metric tonne 
   are greatly deviated from its mean compared to the order quantity in metric 
   tonne, as standard deviation of 'Rateâ€™ and 'Quantity' are 9641.89 & 6.67 
   respectively.
''' 

'''Relationship between 'Rate' & 'Quantity' with scatter plot:'''
plt.scatter(x = steel.Rate, y = steel.Quantity) 
plt.xlabel('Cost per metric tonne')
plt.ylabel('Quantity in metric tonne')
plt.title('Cost vs Order Quantity') 

'''
From the scatter plot, a big tight cluster & outliers both exist.
1) Cluster: Tight cluster suggests there is a strong some kind of positive 
            relationship between cost per metric tonne and quantity ordered in 
            metric tonne, which means cheaper cost is resulting in a more orders.

2) Outliers: Suggests an existence of outliers in dataset.
'''

'''
EDA Conclusion: As there are outliers, potential missing values, data distribution 
                skewness, non-numeric categorical and unnecessary features present 
                in the dataset, a subsequential data cleaning & organizing 
                process is needed.
